Introduction
------------

MPTRAC is a new Lagrangian particle dispersion model for the
troposphere and stratosphere. The model has been developed to support
the analysis of atmospheric transport processes. It calculates
air parcel trajectories based on given meteorological data products.
The model is particularly suited for ensemble simulations on
supercomputers due to its MPI/OpenMP hybrid parallelization.


Algorithms
----------

The primary task of the model is to solve the kinematic equation of
motion for atmospheric air parcels based on numerical integration.
Turbulent diffusion and sub-grid scale wind fluctuations are simulated
with Markov chain models. Additional modules are implemented to simulate
the sedimentation of air parcels and the decay of particle mass.


Implementation
--------------

MPTRAC is written in the C programming language and consists of
about 5,000 lines of code. It uses the GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
for numerical operations. The Unidata netCDF library is used for
task-local file-I/O. MPTRAC can be used on a desktop PC, but it also
features an MPI/OpenMP hybrid-parallelization for efficient use
on supercomputers.
